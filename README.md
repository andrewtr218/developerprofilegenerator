# developerprofilegenerator
The final intended use of this application is to generate a PDF profile for a github user based on their username. PDF conversion functionality has not yet been implemented. A video demo of work so far will be linked at the end. It will begin from the command terminal and end at the display of the html file.

## Index.js
Index.js generates the index.html file and will eventually use this file to generate the PDF file directly without any UI interaction with front-end of browsers.

## GeolocationFragSave.html
This contains vestigial code of obtaining a website users location and embedding the google map of their current location. Used this before realizing employers would more likely rather see the location of the github account owner.

## Package.json & Package-lock.json
Used to call in several useful packages used for the conversion
